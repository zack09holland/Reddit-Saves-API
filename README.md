# Reddit-Saves-API
First ever python script I wrote to learn the basics Python, connecting to an API as well as doing file input/output.
```
########################################################################################
#	This program was created to organize my saves on Reddit to allow me 
#	to quickly find a post that I am interested in knowing. The program
#	will go through the list of any user' saves and grab the necessary 
#	information using PRAW. After the information is stored, a holding
#	directory is created to store each subreddit directory and its 
#	corresponding postings
#

# Usage
# 1. git clone repository
# 2. Change directory to respository
# 3. Create a text file containing Reddit username and password split by a space and save it
#    in the same directory
# 2. Run the program by typing 
#       python redditSaves.py name_of_login_info.txt
# 3. View results of your saved posts on Reddit in the directory 'SubReddits'
